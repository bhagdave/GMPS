## About GMPS

GMPS is intended to become a **simple** interface to a Matrix server that allows the user to create users and rooms (groups in GMPS) and allow them to control the access to those groups and rooms.  The goal was to provide the most simple code possible in a complete application that people could then use as a basis for their own work.

As you may have noticed I have not got that far with the code yet but I am building it in my spare time and updates can be found on [my blog](http://www.dave-gill.co.uk).  

## Basis
The interface to the matrix server in the code is based on the work from the [Matrix PHP SDK](https://github.com/updivision/matrix-php-sdk) package from [updivision](https://github.com/updivision).  

## Contributing
If you fancy helping out then fork the repo and create a PR. Please note that I wanted to make this as simple as possible.
