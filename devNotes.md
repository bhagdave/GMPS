#**DEVNOTES**

Notes to remind me what I have done and where stuff is, especially that stuff which is not obvious.

##Login
There is a Listener awaiting for LoginAttempts which calls the Matrix code to attempt a login to the matrix network.  There is no reference to this in the login code as the standard laravel AUTH is used.

##Matrix code
All of the matrix code is in app\Matrix
